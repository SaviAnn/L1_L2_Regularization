# Regularization Techniques Repository

Welcome to the Regularization Techniques Repository! This repository is designed to help you refine your skills with regularization techniques in machine learning. It includes various Jupyter notebooks that illustrate core concepts and practical applications.

## Files

### `Lin_Regression.ipynb`

This notebook covers the fundamental concepts of linear regression. It provides an overview of regression analysis and illustrates the problem of overfitting. You'll learn about the impact of regularization on model performance and how it helps in avoiding overfitting.

### `L1_L2_Animation.ipynb`

In this notebook, you'll explore L1 (Lasso), L2 (Ridge), and L1-L2 (ElasticNet) regularization from a mathematical perspective. It demonstrates how weights are influenced by regularization penalties. Additionally, you can create animations or GIFs to visualize the impact of regularization on your data.

### `Regularization_case.ipynb`

This notebook presents a case study illustrating how to solve a specific problem using regularization techniques. It highlights the issue of feature redundancy and demonstrates methods to reduce or completely eliminate the influence of redundant features.

## How to Use

1. **Explore `Lin_Regression.ipynb`** to understand the basics of regression and see how regularization can mitigate overfitting.
2. **Review `L1_L2_Animation.ipynb`** to gain insights into how L1 and L2 regularizations affect model weights and to visualize these effects with custom animations.
3. **Analyze `Regularization_case.ipynb`** to see a practical example of dealing with feature redundancy and applying regularization techniques to improve model performance.

Enjoy your exploration of regularization techniques!
